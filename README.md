# Template project for ReactJS apps

This project is a template with boilerplate code built up during the online course `Modern JavaScript Tooling with React` from egghead.io.

## Installing

In order to create a new project with ReactJS from this template, run the following command in your terminal from the directory you plan to create the project (replace the `<project-name>` to the name you want for your project):

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adolfoweloy/react-template-project/master/install.sh | \
bash -s <project-name>
```

The result will be a directory with the given `project-name` with the `package.json`'s `name` attribute set to the `project-name` as well.
This script will also initialise a new Git repository.

## Using Flow

If you want to create the project with Flow support, run the following command:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adolfoweloy/react-template-project/with-flow/install.sh | \
bash -s <project-name>
```
